# Project Context - RAG Workshop

## Repository Overview
This is a workshop repository for building Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications. The project contains educational materials and implementations for learning RAG concepts from basic to advanced levels. This is used for the O'Reilly training course: "Building Reliable RAG Applications: From PoC to Production".

The structure of the workshop:
1. We start with Naive-rag concepts and do the hands on with Naive-rag notebook
2. Then we talk about naive-rag-challenges. Where we discuss where it does not fare well and the need for advanced techniques.
3. Then we jump on advanced rag section where we first talk about reranking. And show practically hw the score gets improved the reranker.
4. Then we show hybrid search and how the score gets further improved the hybrid search.

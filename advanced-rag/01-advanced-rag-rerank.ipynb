    "1. **Context Quality Focus**: RAGAS specifically measures how well your retrieval system finds and ranks relevant information\n",
    "2. **Purpose-Built for RAG**: Unlike general evaluation tools, RAGAS is designed specifically for RAG systems\n",
    "3. **Objective Measurement**: Quantitative metrics that measure actual retrieval performance\n",
    "4. **Debugging Aid**: Low context scores immediately tell you where your RAG is failing\n",
    "5. **Optimization Guide**: Use these metrics to systematically improve your retrieval strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "🔬 **What makes RAGAS special**: \n",
    "- **Context Precision** helps ensure the most relevant information appears first\n",
    "- **Context Recall** ensures you're not missing important information\n",
    "- **Context Relevancy** validates that retrieved chunks actually help answer the question\n",

    "### Why Reranking?\n",
    "\n",
    "While vector similarity search is good at finding semantically related content, it has limitations:\n",
    "- **Bi-encoder limitation**: Vector embeddings compress all information into a fixed-size representation\n",
    "- **Lost nuances**: Subtle relevance signals can be lost in the embedding process\n",
    "- **No query-document interaction**: Embeddings are created independently\n",
    "\n",
    "Reranking solves these issues by:\n",
    "- **Cross-encoder architecture**: Processes query and document together\n",
    "- **Fine-grained relevance**: Captures subtle semantic relationships\n",

    "2. **Reranking Benefits**: Cross-encoder models like Cohere's reranker significantly improve context selection\n",
    "3. **Measurable Improvements**: RAGAS metrics clearly show the performance gains\n",

    "### Architecture Comparison\n",
    "\n",
    "**Naive RAG:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Query → Embedding → Vector Search (Top 3) → Generate Answer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "Query → Embedding → Vector Search (Top 10) → Rerank (Top 3) → Generate Answer\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Reranking\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use reranking when:**\n",
    "- Answer quality is critical\n",
    "- You have complex, nuanced queries\n",
    "- Your corpus contains similar but subtly different content\n",
    "- You can afford the additional API call latency\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Skip reranking when:**\n",
    "- Speed is more important than accuracy\n",
    "- Queries are simple and unambiguous\n",
    "- Your corpus has clearly distinct topics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Further Improvements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Hybrid Search**: Combine vector search with keyword search\n",
    "2. **Query Expansion**: Generate multiple query variations\n",
    "3. **Document Expansion**: Add metadata and summaries to chunks\n",
    "4. **Fine-tuning**: Train custom rerankers on your domain\n",
    "5. **Caching**: Store reranked results for common queries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Try It Yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment with:\n",
    "- Different `initial_top_k` values (try 20, 50)\n",
    "- Different `final_top_k` values (try 5, 7)\n",
    "- Different reranking models\n",
    "- Your own questions and see the improvement!"
